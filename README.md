# Zed Configuration folder

This is my config. It may or may not work for you.  I come from emacs and my fingers are now also adapted to working on a Mac all day.

So this is my crazy but works for me key mapping.

Clone this repo to your home directory and then link the zed folder to ~/.config/zed - at least on Linux and MacOS.
